  - Drag this csv file into the folder and run data_visualizer.py


## Quick Note
  - Neuron: Index or label.
  - FPS: Data capture rate.
  - Peak Intensities: Maximum observed intensity.
  - Distances: Spatial or peak-to-peak distance.
  - Peak Location (s): Time of peak intensity.
  - Peak Value Amplitude: Height of the peak above baseline.
  - FWHM (s): Duration of the peak.
  - Mean Rise Rate (s^-1): Average rate of intensity increase.
  - Stdev Mean Rise Rate(s^-1): Variability in rise rate.
  - Peak Rise Rate (s^-1): Maximum rate of intensity increase.
  - Mean Fall Rate(s^-1): Average rate of intensity decrease.
  - Stdev Mean Fall Rate(s^-1): Variability in fall rate.
  - Peak Fall Rate (s^-1): Maximum rate of intensity decrease.
